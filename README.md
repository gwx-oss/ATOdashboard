# Authority to Operate (ATO) Dashboard

This repository/site is used for the organization and collaborative creation and management of the various *Controls* and *System*  Documentation used to inform a Federal Agency Project's Authorization to Operate (ATO). Documentation is structured in accordance with GSA's Lightweight ATO or (LATO) for a FIMSA Compliance utilizing NIST standard format 800 (NIST 800 rev.4 - See Data and Docs directory for all referenced materials). The site provides a minimalist approach to separately managing Security Documentation across and amongst teams and boundaries.
